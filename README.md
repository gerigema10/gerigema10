- ğŸ‘‹ Halo! Hei! Hej!
- ğŸ‘€ I am currently handling business process development
- ğŸŒ± I'm learning Python to build software, and I'm also using it to explore things like data science, data analysis, and business insights. I want to understand how to work with data, make it useful, and find important information from it. Ultimately, my big goal is to become a recognized software developer.
